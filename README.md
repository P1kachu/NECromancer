IDA Pro V850 Processor Module Extension


This plugin extends the V850E1 IDA processor module by adding support
for certain V850E2 instructions on a per need basis. Rather than modifying
the source code of the V850E1 IDA processor module, this script has been
developed as an exercise in writing a processor module extension in
IDAPython, particularly for version 7 of IDA and onwards.

## Installation
Copy NECromancer.py to your IDA plugins directory
